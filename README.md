# 3dcg-final-project

## Controls

`Add basic controls (like how to move the camera/switch between viewpoints here)`

### Views

### Animate Robot Arm

## Minimal features:

- [ ] Multiple viewpoints. For example, a top view and a third-person camera that follows a character. The position and movement of the camera is up to you. You can also create a cutscene to add new viewpoints.
- [ ] Advanced shading: include more complex material models, such as PBR shaders.
- [ ] Material textures: e.g., kd, ks, shininess, roughness.
- [ ] Normal mapping.
- [ ] Environment mapping.
- [ ] Smooth paths: at least one feature of your demo should make use of smooth paths using Bézier curves. It can be the movement of a model, a light source, or a camera. Use a path composed of at least three Cubic Bézier curves.
- [ ] Hierarchical transformations: include one object with several animated components. This should be done in code, not imported from Blender. Practical examples are robot arm, snake, solar system, vehicle composed of multiple parts

## Extra effects:

## Grading

The final project counts for 60% of the final grade. The grade of the final project is divided as follows.

The final project grade is capped to a maximum of 10 points for each student.

- Part 1: max 2 points
- Part 2 minimum requirements: max 4 points
- Part 3 extra features: unlimited

## Submission

- [ ] the source code (do not include build files!)
- [ ] a short report (max 500 words) of the implemented techniques each accompanied by at least two screen shots (more are welcome) to well illustrate each method. Do not forget to include references!
- [ ] a list of the work done by each individual group member with a percentage indication (first page of report, not included in the word count).
- [ ] a video for your tech-demo. No slides are necessary, your demo should showcase all your features. Max 4 minutes! Since there is no live presentation your video will be posted in Brightspace so other groups can also appreciate your work.
